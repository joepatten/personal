## Course Description

This course serves as a refresher for linear algebra, univariate calculus, and multivariate calculus. In addition, it will cover important topics meant to help you begin to acquire what is often called *mathematical maturity* through covering basic topics in logic, set theory and proofs.  It is designed to help prepare you mathematically for the math course in the fall semester.  This is an active-learning course.  Lecture notes will be posted online.  Please note that the instructor(s) of **EconS 506** course during the Fall semester may assess your knowledge of the topics covered in this summer course with an exam in the first week of the Fall semester, and **<font color="red">the score will affect your grade in the EconS 506 course</font>**.

#### Course Learning Goals

**At the end of this course, students should be able to**:
>Understand and have working knowledge of mathematics used in PhD-level economics.  Students will learn/review calculus of one variable and of several variables, linear algebra and matrix properties.  Students will also learn some logic, set theory and proof strategies useful for learning and understanding more advanced mathematical concepts. 

**The following will address this outcome**:
> Assigned readings and problem sets.

**This outcome will be evaluated primarily by**:
> Completion of problem sets and exams.

### Course Materials

The following are some recommended textbooks.  The primary book used for this course will be Simon & Blume's "*Mathematics for Economists*".  However, Simon & Blume's text, by itself, is inadequate for modern mathematics, you should expect to consult other texts.  I will provide other notes as additional resources, particularly for the set theory and proofs sections.

### Grading, Exams, and Homework 
Grading will be based off points accumulated through assignments and the exam.

| Course Items | Points |
| :---   | :---:  |
| Assignment 1 | 20 |
| Assignment 2 | 20 |
| Assignment 3 | 20 |
| Exam | 40 |
| **Total** | **100** |

**Final Grade**
The letter grade corresponding to the final point total is provided in the table below.

| Point Range | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- |
| 93-100 | A |
| 90-92.99 | A- |
| 87-89.99 | B+ |
| 83-86.99 | B |

| 70-72.99 | C- |
| 67-69.99 | D+ |
| 60-66.99 | D |
| < 59.99 | F |

#### Workload

It is WSU policy that for every hour of faculty directed activities, students should expect a minimum of two hours engaged in supportive learning activities.  Depending on your skills and knowledge as a learner, additional time may be required.

In this course, there will be no official "faculty directed time" and the workload will in all honesty be substantial for all individuals that have not had a significant amount of prior mathematics education.

#### Assignments

An assignment will be posted on the course website.  Due dates are given below.  <font color="red">**The assignments should be submitted as PDF files by 11:59 pm Pacific Standard Time on the due date**</font>.  Each assignment will be worth 20/100 points.  The assignments will be problem sets that give the students practice applying the mathematical tools covered in the course texts.

##### Homework assignments, *including the math*, should be typed.
As a professional economist you will need to communicate mathematical arguments in a clear, well type-set document.  You may type your homework assignments using $\TeX$ (recommended), MathType, Microsoft Word's equation editor, scientific word, etc.  It is a good idea to invest time and effort gaining proficiency in these tools as you will use them later.  It might seem slow at first, but these assignments will give you practice, making you more fluent in these tools and prepare you for assignments in your first year courses.  If doing so will be a particular hardship for you, or you require an accomodation, then please email me to discuss it.

**NOTE**: If you are working on a chromebook or for some other reason are unable to use any of the above mentioned tools to type your assignments, I recommend using an online browser-based $\LaTeX$ editor.  Some good sites capable of doing simple to complex projects are [Overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com) and [ShareLatex.com](https://www.sharelatex.com).  Both sites have free options that allow you full access without contributors.

For those using $\LaTeX$ I will provide assignment templates for you to use.

#### Exam

There will be one exam at the end of the course and it is worth 40/100 points.  The exam will cover all the material covered in the course.  The exam will be proctored on campus in Hulbert Hall on *Wednesday August 16, 2017*.

*S&B ~ Simon & Blume text*

**Prerequisite Assignment**
The prerequisite assignment will not count toward your grade for the course, but you will be entirely accountable for the mastery of the related content in EconS 506.  The assignment is given as a chance for you to review and practice the univariate calculus and assess your level of mastery of the content.

### Students with Disabilities
