### Bidisha Meeting Notes

- Cover Simon & Bloome Chapters 2 - 9 and 14
- Do lots of problems and practice
- Test up through multivariate calculus
- Create assignments and show to Bidisha
- Emphasize matrix inversion and determinants
- Especially Ch 7,8, and 9
- Use examples in Ch 6

### Proof Texts

- [Art of Proof](http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/aop.html) I can't distribute it, but I think I can point students to the site to get the pdf for themselves
- [Book of Proof](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=7) Good text from open textbooks.
- [Mathematical Reasoning: Writing and Proof](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/SearchResults.aspx) Another open textbook

All the books above appear to be freely available in electronic versions. However, I don't think I have the right to host *Art of Proof* on my site, but should be able to point students to it for their personal use.  The third book is not really that exciting so I am not sure I want to use it.  The book *Book of Proof* is the most concise and seems to follow a simple flow, but uses notation without explaining it. *Art of Proof* on the other hand really seems to hold the student's hand more and tries to introduce ideas in a different order to take advantage the the student's prior experience with mathematics.  This approach comes at the cost of the students needing to do more reading and so I don't know which is worse.  I also don't have time to vet all these sources but will need to come up with useful exercises.  I guess I will just create assignments and then point them to texts that may, or may not, help them to solve the problems.

In addition, the first 1 or 2 chapters from *An Introduction to Mathematical Analysis for Economic Theory and Econometrics* give quite a concise introduction to logic, truth tables, notation and so on.  Perhaps I could share those resources as well.  Put it all up and have the students read whatever they have to in order to "get it."

> I am going to use chapters 1 and 2 from Chartrand's book under fair use laws for the students to pickup basics of set notation and logic.

The actual problems that I plan to include are going to be given below.

- **Section 1.2**: 1.11, 1.17, 1.19   
- **Section 1.3**: 1.23, 1.25, 1.31

### Assignment 1 Notes

So using the open textbook *Book of Proof* the chapters dealing specifically with proof are going to be

- 4: Direct Proof
- 5: Contrapositive Proof
- 6: Proof by Contradiction
- 7: Proving Non-Conditional Statements
- 8: Proofs Involving Sets
- 9: Disproof
- 10: Mathematical Induction

Chapters 11 and 12 cover relations and functions.  I need to decide how important covering relations and functions is.  Regarding functions, how useful is injection, surjection, bijection, composition, inverses and things like image and preimage?  I know in analysis image and preimage is an important concept to have down.  Bijection is important for existence of inverses and the meaning behind statements in economics like "1-to-1 correspondence".

Given I only have five days in the first week, I need to cover material quickly.  Obvioiusly I am going to have to accept the fact that only so much can possibly be absorbed in a few days.  So below I am thinking of the following schedule:

- **Monday**: BoP chapters 4,5
- **Tuesday**: BoP chapters 6,7
- **Wednesday**: BoP chapters 8,9
- **Thursday**: Relations and Functions
- **Friday**: Applications & Practice
- **Saturday**: Work on problems


I could use pieces of other texts for supplements in the relations and functions space.  From Carter for example:

1. Relations - pdf page 26 - 41 and 49-52
2. Functions - pdf page 162 - 168

I could also pull some chapters from Munkre's Topology
pdf pages: 18 - 44

What about Efe Okay's Book?  Chapter A is on preliminaries of Real Analysis.
pdf page: 20 - 38
rational preference theory - pdf page: 96 - 104

Also, there is *Set Theory for the Working Mathematician*:
pdf pages: 20 - 32
