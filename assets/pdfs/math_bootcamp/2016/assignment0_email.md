<!--Assignment 0 Email-->

Hello Math Campers!

I hope you all are doing well.  I have not yet received a response from all of you about whether you are receiving my emails and can access the site.  If you have not already responded to my previous email, then please respond to this one letting me know that I am reaching you and that you can access the site (http://brettdevine.github.io/_teaching/math_bootcamp/) without problems.

### Assignment 0 Facts

The prerequisite reading and assignment are posted on the course website.  Below are some important facts pertaining to the assignment and material.

- The calculus content of Assignment 0 is not comprehensive. Make sure that you are good with all the matrial in Simon & Blume chapters 1 - 5.
- The problems are intended to *nudge* you to practice and remember concepts that you might have forgot or that have become rusty.
- You should complete the assignment and be familiar with the concepts covered by the deadline of July 13th.
- You do not have to turn the assignment into me.
- Even though you won't turn in the assignment, I will assume you did the assignment and you will be accountable for the content in later assignments and the final exam.
- While you won't turn this assignment in to me, you will turn the rest of the assignments in to me.
- If you have any questions about any of the problems or concepts, feel free to email me.

### Week 1 Information

The week one readings will cover methods of proof including:

- Direct proof
- Contrapositive proof
- Proof by contradiction
- Existence proofs, proofs involving sets, etc.

In addition we will cover important and useful set theory concepts like

- Relations
- Ordered Sets
- Functions

The main text for these topics is an open textbook (trying to save you guys money) called "*Book of Proof*" by Richard Hammack from Virginia Commonwealth University.  There are other texts listed on the syllabus that are also beneficial.  In addition, I am considering supplying some additional textbook excerpts for the relations and functions material.  I will keep you posted.

I am still developing Assignment 1 for the proofs content.
