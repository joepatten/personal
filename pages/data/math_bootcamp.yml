    descrip: >
      <b>Univariate calculus, sets, and logic</b>. You will need the Sets & Logic
      reading to complete the assignment. The material in this assignment is
      fair game for the final exam.  You should complete these problems to
      refresh old topics and learn some new ones.  However, you do not need to
      turn this assignment in to me.  I will assume your understanding and familiarity
      with the material during the mathcamp, so please complete your study no later than
      July 13th.
    due: First week or two.
